# Dynamica v2 - Perpetual Prediction Markets

## Project Essence

**Dynamica** is a platform for creating perpetual prediction markets built on blockchain. Markets offer the ability to predict the ratio of several continuous quantities and bet money on it. The project implements a modern market making system using the **Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule (LMSR)** algorithm, which ensures continuous trading and automatic price discovery.

### Core Concepts:

- **Perpetual Markets**: Markets operate continuously with automatic transitions between epochs
- **LMSR Algorithm**: Uses logarithmic scoring function for price and liquidity determination
- **Multi-Outcome Markets**: Support for up to 10 different outcomes in one market
- **Time Weights**: Reward system considering trading participation time
- **Cross-Chain Oracles**: Integration with Chainlink oracles

## Main Features and Characteristics

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Capabilities

1. **Continuous Trading**
   - Automatic transitions between epochs and periods
   - Continuous liquidity without waiting for market resolution
   - Dynamic pricing based on current state

2. **Advanced Market Making**
   - LMSR algorithm for efficient price discovery
   - Automatic scaling to maintain liquidity
   - Protection against manipulation through mathematical constraints

3. **Time-based Weights and Incentives**
   - Gamma power system to encourage early predictions
   - Decreasing multipliers for later periods
   - Fair distribution of rewards

4. **Modular Oracle Architecture**
   - Chainlink support for Hedera
   - FTSO integration for Flare Network
   - Extensible system for adding new oracles

5. **Gas Efficiency**
   - Use of minimal proxies (EIP-1167)
   - Optimized mathematical computations
   - Batch processing of operations

### ðŸ”§ Technical Features

- **Smart Contracts**: Written in Solidity 0.8.25
- **Mathematical Library**: PRB Math for precise calculations
- **Token Standards**: ERC-1155 for outcome tokens, ERC-20 for collateral
- **Security**: OpenZeppelin contracts and upgradeable proxies
- **Testing**: Complete test suite with Foundry

### ðŸ“Š Market Structure

- **Epochs**: Main time periods (configurable)
- **Periods**: Epoch subdivisions for time weights
- **Outcomes**: Up to 10 possible event results
- **Collateral**: Any ERC-20 token for trading

## System Architecture
